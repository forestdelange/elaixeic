So I'm running Win10 on a Acer Aspire Nitro Black Edition, and I've had some spotty on and off internet on my network at school. Figured I'd update the wifi driver (Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4) just as a starting point, but when I try and auto-update through the device manager it says its the most recent version. So then I start double checking (because I've found the auto-update to give a false positive before) and I found some examples online (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/win.

Every device on the network is wireless and works fine except my Windows 10 desktop PC. Speed test results (all tests on wireless): Phone results are 26/1.5 Mbps (with it physically sitting on the desktop PC) Desktop connected to AC68U = 0.9/1.4 Mbps Desktop connected to T3200 = 23.0/1.6 Mbps (reset to defaults temporarily) It appears only the PC download speed.

My Dell Inspiron 5570 Wi-Fi adapter doesn't seem to be working. Can't open Wi-Fi settings and Bluetooth, as well. Wi-Fi adapter and Bluetooth driver seem to be missing from Device Manager. What I have done to troubleshoot: Reinstalled Wi-Fi/Bluetooth drivers (Qualcomm.) from Dell Website. Reinstalled. Drivers were installed but Wi-Fi still don't work.

I have successfully installed WiFi adapter drivers (Qualcomm Atheros QCA9377), and downloaded Wifi-Radar for scanning and connecting to WiFi networks. The problem is that when I choose a network to connect to (Wifi Radar properly scans btw) a window pops up that says "Acquiring IP address (DHCP)" and this is taking forever.

My Wi-fi is not working. I am typing this using my phone to tether. The issue is, it does not detect any available Wi-Fi networks. There is no Wi-Fi section in the settings, and I can't find my driver (Qualcomm) in device manager (even after show hidden networks) I have tried many things, including troubleshooting, downloading all the suggested Dell updates, redownloading the driver (On the Dell website, it's listed as a WiFi + Bluetooth device toshiba satellite c660 сетевой драйвер.

Qualcomm Technologies’ suite of smart technology and automotive solutions allows car manufacturers to expand their existing accessory package offerings to include advanced on-board features, including connectivity, infotainment, navigation and driver safety. The past couple of days, my HP laptop has been randomly freezing up, forcing me to force shut-down and restart. I started going through the motions of figuring out what could be causing this issue. One thing I found was my network driver, Qualcomm Atheros AR9485, is on version 3.0.2.201 (https://3.0.2.201). On the "update driver", Windows is saying that I have the current driver installed. Upon further investigation, there seems to be drivers up to version 10. Do I trust Windows and stick. Прошивка и разблокировка модемов/телефонов Huawei, ZTE, Alcatel. Для сброса графического пароля.

Like everything else, baseband security could be better, but I don't think it has the urgency / severity that's attributed to it vs. everything else. It's not a particularly weak spot in the security of Pixel phones. Airplane mode also does work properly for reducing the attack surface when it's not needed. There are people that have done real research on it but there's not a lot that's up-to-date. Simply ignore sensationalist journalism glossing over the details and making false assumptions.

Chrome, Git pretty much everything works and is certainly connected to the internet. However apps like Edge, Store and the operation system as a whole is not connected.

As far as I can tell, the network adapter is going through the pci-e lanes.

 Every time I restart my computer, my internet connection seems to have erratic connection spikes. The most common pattern is being perfectly fine for around 30 seconds to a minute, followed by around a 5-7 second spike in which my ping to servers about quadruples. I use VOIP and play online games a lot, so this is a pretty huge hindrance. One solution I have found is that if I reinstall the drivers to my wireless card, the issue resolves temporarily, but comes back the next time I restart Hi everyone, thanks for taking time to try to help me solve this. My laptop which is a Clevo W350ST,(bought 2 years ago) ~~i7-4700mq~~, gtx 765m , 8gb corsair ram (1600MHz) , Killer wireless n-1202 , ~~Windows 7~~ would constantly bluescreen or freeze even if I managed to boot into safe mode before being totally not bootable. ampnbsp; I brought it back to the shop I got it from and after running a diagnosis determined that my cpu and the mobo intergrated circuit was damaged. This error has only started occurring in the last two days. Whenever I connect my computer to HDMI it BSODs. Before this, there were errors where online streaming services such as youtube and hulu wouldn't load when it was connected to HDMI, but if i loaded and started playing the video, then connected to HDMI, it would run fine. Now it has graduated to full on crashing. I used whocrashed to analyze the crashes, details are below with that. There are two main problems though. 
I bought an XPS 13 in December and since then the Bluetooth has completely stopped working, it won't find any Bluetooth devices and I know they all work. To try and fix the problem I've reinstalled the Bluetooth drivers (Qualcomm Atheros QCA61x4 Bluetooth 4.1), reset the bios to factory settings and updated the bios to the newest version. Also when running the dell diagnostic test for the Bluetooth it says it's functioning but it still never finds the available devices. I'm thinking Driver: Qualcomm Atheros AR8161 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.30) Using this (https://www.atheros.cz/atheros-wireless-download.php?chipset=87ampsystem=8) site but I can't get the driver- whenever I try to download it I get a 404 error. Any other site that I can get these drivers. So i'm trying to update my AW15, i won't do it through device manager since last time i tried that i ended up bluescreening every 10sec and had to revert to a recovery. So i look for wireless drivers on the dell website and find 2 versions of drivers for the same laptop hardware, do i install both or which one is what?

I have searched so long to find a solution to this but I just cannot find one. It's not a serious issue, but more of an annoyance if anything. As people probably know, this error occurs every once in awhile and causes my computer to restart with the error labeled "DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION" I currently have used WhoCrashed to give me an explanation of what is going on and it seams to be a driver issue with my Wifi card and also something wrong with my operating system functioning. As far as I remember no other Android phone has received more than 3 Android versions. And by that I'm not counting increments like 4.2 to 4.3 jellybean. I'm thinking full renamed OS updates. This puts it in a very special position. If it gets the final release of Q, and it should, then this really gives me hope for the pixel 2/3. Does anyone agree. Today I charged up my 6P, I took it off the charger, it was 100%. I loaded up instagram and looked through if there was anything new. I locked the phone and I headed to my grandparents house. I used the phone there too, to send a few messages. After that, I got home and I wanted to check my phone for notifications and. well. it was just black. Thought it somehow turned off. I held the power button, nothing. Put it on the charger for a few mins, and tried again. Nothing. Tried connecting. OS: Windows 10 PC: Toshiba Satellite L755-19G Part Number: PSK2YE RAM: 4GB DDR3 CPU: intel i5 Wireless Adapter Driver: Qualcomm Atheros AR9002WB-1NG Hi, After upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 7, I realised I needed to replace an outdated version of the wireless adapter driver by uninstaling then installing the driver. I did so but I realised that if I disable the wireless adapter, the whole thing bluescreens with the error "SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED". Looking for Qualcomm USB Drivers?
