Serato is saying that I need to install the DDJ SR driver and when I click the link it takes me to pioneer's website for the DDJ SR (https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/support/software/ddj-sr/) which does not have the driver download. Instead the driver is downloaded through a CD that was provided when I purchased the controller. I uninstalled and re-installed the driver for the DDJ SR using the disc provided at purchase and it is showing up under program filesx86gtpioneergtpioneer DDJ_SR ASIO. With Serato DJ now supporting Ableton Link, I thought I might try to incorporate some sequencing and looping into my DJ sets using Ableton. However, it seems that the soundcard in my controller (Pioneer DDJ SR) is only able to recognize one of the programs at once. So, I have Serato up and running, but then when I open Ableton, it says "failed to open ASIO Pioneer DDJ SR driver" (or something like that). Likewise, if I open Ableton first, it can run the driver properly, but then Serato never.

The included full version (correct me if I'm wrong) of Serato DJ comes with the controller. My question is whether this software and the DDJ-SR drivers are compatible with Windows 8. I have a Lenovo Ideapad Y-510 laptop that should easily be able to handle the software and controller processing demands (again, correct me if I'm wrong, 4th gen i7 processor, 8gb ram) but I don't know if Windows 8 will still work.

I have a real head scratcher with me here, and I'm hoping I can find some help in this community. I have a DDJ-SR that I'm using with my 2012 Macbook on OSX 10.10 with Serato. My issue is that only one of my 9 USB cables work with the DDJ-SR. The USB cables that do not work, will allow the DDJ-SR to be recognized, have the LED lights working, and control Serato, but I get no master output signal. I do see activity on the CH 1/2 VU meter, but nothing out of my speakers.

I just purchased a brand new DDJ SR and went through all the steps to set it up with speakers and headphones in the manual. However, the output sound on the speakers is exceptionally low even with the master and trim turned all the way up. When I cue a song even with the headphone mix turned all the way to cue it doesn't play. I am using a Mac so pioneer says I dont need to install any drivers. I dont think it is an issue with the controller either because I even exchanged the controller.

Controller: Pioneer DDJ-SR Software: Serato DJ 1.9.2 Computer: Windows 10, Acer Shitbook^^tm with all hardware requirements for Serato fulfilled and an external hard drive velcro-ed to the back It shows that the DDJ-SR is connected, show's that it's activated, but only switches to hardware mode and lets me mix for half a second. Drivers are working Audio devices are configured properly Midi input is detected and working properly I tested the DDJ-SR on another Breakermixer a veces no puede responder porque tiene que trabajar, tener vida social, familiar y dormir :) Lamento decirte que tanto el Denon HC5000 como el Allen & Heath Xone:DX han dejado de tener soporte por parte de sus respectivos fabricantes. 
Few notes: - Pretty much all of this info comes from Wikipedia or some form of wrestling wiki. Take this with a grain of salt. - For the clips of each maneuver, I tried to use footage of the wrestler who innovated the move using it, though this wasn't possible in some cases. - Some of these origins are particularly debatable, and I will try to point these out. - I will be updating this list for as long as it takes. If you have a suggestion, notice a link is broken, that I got something wrong. No one becomes a teacher for the money. You’re in the classroom because the rewards of being a teacher still compensate (on most days at least) for the low pay and long, grueling hours. Teaching after all is a public service, not a business. But are teaching and entrepreneurship mutually exclusive. I bought the DDJ-SR today. I have my RCA cables coming in 2 days but until then I figured I'd use it with the headphones that I have. I downloaded all the drivers, serato, registered the controller, and I'm still not getting any sound out of the headphones and the lights for channel/master in the mixer aren't lighting up telling me there isn't sound at all. Any idea what the issue is? I tried contacting pioneer but their support is closed for the day. I'm assuming it's a driver issue, wasn't. Hello, I recently took a break from mixing due to working heavy overtime. I came back about 3 months later using my DDJ SR and Serato. I had only headphones plugged in through the jack. I queued a song and hit play. I had no sound whatsoever, I reinstalled Serato as well as the drivers multiple times. Not only on my Mac but my Pc runnings Windows 7 as well. Still no sound, sifting through forums and google articles I attempted every troubleshooting visible. I contacted Pioneer and reported Title basically says it all. My Pioneer DDJ-SR randomly loses audio during play. Everything in the software and hardware looks as if stuff is still playing, but the music just stops. With Serato DJ still running, I turned off the SR and turned it back on. The sound started working momentarily and then got really glitchy before shutting off again. I am on the newest firmware and drivers for the SR, and the latest version of Serato. I had literally JUST installed all of that stuff because previou. I recently purchased a Pioneer DDJ-SR that I am using with Serato on a Samsung Series 9 Ultrabook with 64 bit windows 7. My drivers and firmware are up to date, but when I play a track in Serato with my DDJ-SR connected i hear no sound! It is connected via midi out to USB in with the cable that was included with the equipment. I would very much appreciate getting help on this, as I want to start mixing asap! edit: For clarity, without the DDJ-SR connected, I can play music in Serato Two months ago I was inspired to pick up a DDJ-SR. I've grown up on EDM, getting into the scene when I was about 10, listening to the likes of DJ Alice, Darude(lol), ATB, Paul Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyke and the likes. My passion for music has been recently reignited now that I have the funds to actually attend music festivals, and I began spamming all my friends with random soundcloud links. I figured DJing would be the next logical step to get myself more involved with the music This driver will allow you to connect your DDJ to a computer.
