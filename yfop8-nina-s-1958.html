Following an idea sparked by a comment from u/vistarmonei, I decided to put together a list of lesbian related films.

Nina Simone was one of the most distinctive, individual and complex musical personalities of the second half of the 20th century, her music starting out from the base of the classical music she aspired to perform and compose throughout her career, but which encompassed other influences. For such a little man in stature, the shadow cast on Formula 1 by Bernie is immense. Love him or hate him (many more are in the second camp), his influence on Formula 1 is unparalleled and it is not an exaggeration to say that, without him, we would have a very different sport (if it still existed at all).

Although "Un, deux, trois" did not win /r/esctournament's 1976 ranking, it was the only song to score over 300 points here. Had /u/alphaman21 not submitted his results at the last minute, the result would have been a win for "L'oiseau et l'enfant" with "Un, deux, trois" in second.

gtゴジラ! gt-Godzilla, 1954- --- Children are known to have a wild imagination. When we get older, that imagination may fade. We see how things 'really' are. We are able to rationalize and stop seeing things that are not there. This might not apply to everyone. For centuries, many countries filled folklore, mythology, legends, and lies with creatures.
